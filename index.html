                <p> Recently, I celebrated my 1 year anniversary working at this retail store as a seasonal worker.
                    Along the way, it has allowed me to consistently deliver a high level of personal custmomer service,
                    and maximize store profit with a 3.8 UPT at cashout. This opportunity has allowed me to develop an understanding
                    in the finances and logistics that are involved in the running of a successful business.
